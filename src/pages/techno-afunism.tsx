            <p>
              We are at a point where we must choose to overcome our status quo. The African has been in the dimness for too long. Now is the time for us to step forward to accelerate creation and build more and more.
            </p>
            <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-red-400">
              This is a declaration of a new era, where we, the African techno-afunist, rise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Intelligent African creators are those that will create the grand future. It&apos;s obvious not all Africans are willing to contribute and that&apos;s fine. Those who will not contribute will simply read and go on with their lives; there&apos;s nothing more we can expect from them. It&apos;s nature, no matter the race it is always a small percent that are really creators and builders of what everyone will all enjoy even the naysayers.   
            </p>
            <p>
              The will of techno-afunist is to define us by what we will do. We will use our strength, our history, and our future to become more than we have ever been. We are here to procreate and evolve and we believe technology and science is key for Africa&apos;s great future.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is our call to arms, our declaration of intent. We will thrive. We will command our narrative. As a techno-afunist be ready to assert yourself, as an African be ready to take what is ours by right.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-400">
              The urgency is now. The declaration is made. We will rise.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-red-400">The Historical Burden</h2>
            <p>
              Our history isn&apos;t a trophy to be waved around for others to see. We don&apos;t have to prove our worth to anyone other than ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              The great days of Nok, Aksum, and the Bantu are a testament to what&apos;s in our blood. Innovation, resilience, creativity. Our history, our starting line.
            </p>
            <p>
              We should not argue our place in the history books. We&apos;re to write new ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will be greater than ever. Stop looking back to justify your existence. Start looking forward to claim your destiny.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-400">
              The African does not need to prove itself.

            <p>
              Fuck the pessimists, the naysayers, the destroyers who will read this, sneer, and then crawl back to their pathetic, resigned lives. &quot;Introduction to Techno-Afunism&quot; is a wake-up call to the intelligent creators, those ready to accelerate in build the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              The universe doesn&apos;t give a shit about your doubts; it favors growth, complexity, and power. We&apos;ll harness that, creating tech that sets it pace.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-red-950/30 border border-red-500/20 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-red-400">Environment as Catalyst</h3>
              <p>
                Silicon Valley? That&apos;s child&apos;s play compared to what we&apos;ll do with our landscapes. From the deserts to the jungles, we&apos;ll make our environment our tech&apos;s muse. The pessimists will see only barriers as per usual, but we&apos;ll see the raw material for our dominance.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              It&apos;s a war cry. We&apos;re not asking to be part of the tech game; we&apos;re declaring we&apos;ll own it. Technology will be our language, our weapon, our culture. Tech that speaks our truth, solves our issues, and elevates our name.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-400">
              To the useless, the pessimists, the destroyers: watch us or get out of our way. We don&apos;t dream; we know, with the certainty of science and the fire of our heritage, we will succeed. The intelligent creators are the ones being called. This is our declaration, our future. Build, innovate, create, or fuck off.
